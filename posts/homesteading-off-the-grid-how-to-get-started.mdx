## Global Scenario of homesteading off the grid.

![off grid living global scenario](/homesteading-off-the-grid-how-to-get-started/off-grid-living-global-scenario.jpg "off grid living global")

Massive industrialization, Work pattern shift, and trend of the New Era made us what we are doing today. As a citizen of a first-world country, we get everything like a mother feeding her children. You may say your life is hard; then I will say that your forefather’s life was harder than yours. Life is hard, and it’s just a perspective. If you look at other countries, most people live with a scarcity of water; they rarely see the light of electricity in their daily lives. Now you may be wondering why I am saying these things to you. It’s to let you know that they want a life like us, and we want to live life like them. We suffer from what we have built over for many years and want to simplify our living by going off the grid. But for them, they are yet to experience the system’s complexity.The scenario of the majority living off the grid is not by choice. But in our case, we choose it and have the knowledge and ability to control it, unlike them.

## How to choose your Land 

![Choosing land for off grid homesteading](/homesteading-off-the-grid-how-to-get-started/off-grid-living-homesteading-land.jpg "land")

Okay. Enough of philosophical blabbering. First and foremost we need a land to live if we are going to homestead off the grid.And it would be helpful if you get land with some important criteria. The main thing is the price. The further we are from the city and localized area, the less the cost is. I suggest getting something cheap but huge land with access to water nearby like a river, lake or stream. Water is very important for survival. Even if you can’t find a water source nearby, you better dig information about the surface layer of that land so you can create your well. 
Find out about the law in that state or locale. States have different rules and regulations regarding construction and living off the grid. Dig out information by yourself. Better ask someone who is living nearby.
You need to have huge land because you need to pre-plan what you are going to do, so having massive land will give you the benefit of expanding your plan slowly. if you want to know more about finding perfect land for you, then you can read more in this article <Link href="/find-perfect-land-for-off-grid-living"><a target="_blank">"How to choose the Perfect land for off grid living"</a></Link>


## Building house for living off the grid
![Homestead off grid house](/homesteading-off-the-grid-how-to-get-started/off-grid-house-homesteading.jpg "house")


Hire someone to make the house or start slowly build by yourself. If you are Doing it by yourself, you need a vehicle to move your heavy stuff; remember, you are not Tarzan, so you don’t need to create everything from scratch. Building the house is a crucial and hefty task. But keep in mind, the power source you will have might be renewable energy like an off-grid solar power system even if you are not, make the Electrical layout of your house. If you don’t know much about it, try to learn from a book or videos. Otherwise, hire an expert and learn from him while he is up to it. You also need a water and sewage layout for the house. Huh! A lot of stuff to do? Of course, being a homestead off the grid is not easy. Don’t think of doing it super-fast; take your time, learn and do it. Homesteading off the grid is about self-sustainability. So, it’s better to rely on yourself than on others to do it for you. 

## Off grid solar energy power system

Now that you have your Land and House, now you need it to connect with energy sources. The most favorable and best energy source for homesteading off the grid is Solar energy. Make sure your house is not covered or blocked by the shade of a tree or something because it’s important for the solar panel. Better install the solar system on the roof rather than stand-alone beside the house. It will keep your roof clean and covered. You might want to contact the solar panel supplier who has the full package with what you are supposed to need, like an inverter, controller, and battery. Or maybe rather try on your own. I will write a separate article about it, so keep an eye on my other blog posts.

## Off grid water management system

You need to Dig a well if you don’t have water sources nearby. Check your local regulations. It would be better if you could dig a deep well, and It would be best. Survey the geology of your land. The other option will be to store rainwater in a tank and pump it towards the house. It is known as rainwater harvesting. If you have a lake or river nearby, you can fill water in a large container, bring it via vehicle, and fill your main water reservoir tank, which will be supplied to the house by the pump.

## Creating self sunstainable Farm and garden

![homesteading off grid farm garden](/homesteading-off-the-grid-how-to-get-started/off-grid-farm-homesteading.jpg "farm garden")

There is no KFC or MACDONALDS nearby, so make your own Farm. Build chicken coop and raise some chicken. Growing chicks will take some time so buy both hen, cock pairs for breeding. and chicks for slowly growing them and make your own KFC MACDONALDS off the grid. Make a garden and grow vegetables. Check which vegetables are grown in different seasons and plant them in advance.
