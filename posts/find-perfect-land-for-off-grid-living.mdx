Off grid living as a whole is a challenging task, and finding suitable land is crucial for this whole journey. With perfect land, your journey towards off grid homestead living will be like a breeze. This article will focus on finding the right land, the criteria you should have in mind, and the traps you might face during your search.

## 1. Proper Budget, location, and Price

The main things you should keep in mind are your budget, land price, and related costs. Generally, anything far from the city or localization is expected to be less expensive than the other. So, in that case, choose something which is underdeveloped, and that will result in a cheap deal. Look for a property listing website in your country or find an agency and ask them what you are looking for. Make your budget plan because there will also be many costs related to housing and the development of your off grid living journey. Keep an excel record or write notes of what you are going to do and keep it in check before making any decision. Don’t just do something on a massive loan if you cannot afford it.

## 2. Local Regulation and Taxation

Having a bunch of regulations under the neck is common, but since you will be living in an underdeveloped area, ensure your plan will be in line with the laws. For example, you should be able to construct your house and do agriculture. Since you are going to live in an underdeveloped off grid area, make sure to check the environmental regulations of the site.  

The good thing is that the government encourages homestead people in many states and has lower taxation. Though it has some terms and conditions under the hood, paying less tax for the property is not a bad thing. So, check this before choosing the land.  

Checking Regulations and taxation is crucial because it will impact your every plan. So, make sure to sort everything in your favor.

## 3. Trespassing Trap and ease of Connectivity

During your land search, keep an eye on the land’s drawing layout. Don’t buy something where you have to reach your land through someone else’s property or land, and you have to trespass. Normally every land has a common road laid out in the layout by the government, even if it is an underdeveloped area. So, choose the land which is directly connected to the common road.  
Also, ensure you have a highway nearby because you must have road connectivity with your vehicles to go back and forth to the city.

## 4. Geological conditions and Natural Resources

Checking Geological conditions and natural resources nearby is crucial in choosing suitable land for your off grid living.  
Make sure there are available water sources nearby, a lake, a river, or others. Without water sources, progress on your off-grid living journey will be difficult. Alternatively, you can make a deep well for water; for this, you need to ensure the ground layer of the land is suitable. Buying land on top of the hill and digging well will be foolish because the water layer is too deep to dig out. Another choice for having water resources might be rainwater harvesting. So, keep those in mind before looking for the land.  
Choose a land with the availability of Sunlight for turning the Sun into power. So, avoid forest areas if you plan to build a solar system as the power source.  
Check the soil quality of the land. Loosen soil are suitable for agriculture than hardened one. If the ground is hard, you will have extra work to make them loose.

## 5. Scalability and growing opportunity

Living off the grid doesn’t mean you grow and create something only for yourself; instead, you should scale up to the production level so that you can also make money. Being self-sustainable while able to provide for others is also an enjoyment. When choosing the land, try to get a large one to scale up your plan. You can make a farm, raise livestock, grow fish on a small scale, and later on, make it into a bigger one if you have enough land size. If you have ample land, you can store solar power and sell it to the government, so there are many opportunities.  

All these are the essential factor for choosing suitable land for your off grid homesteading Journey. A Land for your future and more challenges. I hope with this article you have a better idea of what to look for and hope you will find the suitable land and wish you success.
