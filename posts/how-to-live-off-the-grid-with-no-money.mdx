## Find free off grid land

![Find free off grid land](/how-to-live-off-the-grid-with-no-money/Find-free-off-grid-land.jpg)

Our first goal is to get a piece of land, and since we do not have money, we have few options that we can look for to live off grid.  

We can start looking for a remote farm where they need people to work in the farm and they will give us free accommodation, food as well as salary. Check job posting in the remote farm, local magazines, and newspapers of those places or check online websites to look for those jobs. In this way if you find a job then you will be able to live in a remote off grid land and also can earn some money.  

Another way is to find free land. There are many opportunities to live in free land and you can start your off-grid journey. However, there are various conditions that need to be satisfied like building a home within a certain period of time and live there. These places can be found in both US and Canada.
